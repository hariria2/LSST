## Kubernetes meeting

### Storage:

+ When you are using Kubernetes, you have to worry about storage if you are not using a major cluster like AWS, etc.
+ Kubernetes won't allow you to mount storage to host node. It manages it abstractly.

### Port rerouting
+ NodePort

In order to handle some networking issues:

+ Kubernetes Rolling deployment
+ Kubernetes canary deployment
